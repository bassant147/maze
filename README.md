# Maze

#### Maze game that runs in the browser. The maze is built from scratch with the canvas API without the use of traditional html elements.
#### Instead a 3rd party library called Matter JS is used to simulate physical elements, map key presses to movement of shapes on screen and detect collisions between different objects inside our app.
